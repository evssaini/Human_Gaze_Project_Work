The paper "Humans Have an Expectation That Gaze Is Directed Toward Them" investigates how people perceive the direction of another’s gaze and posits that humans carry an inherent bias toward interpreting ambiguous gaze as being directed at them.
 The authors employed a Bayesian framework to model gaze perception, proposing that when visual information is degraded or uncertain—such as in low-light conditions or when the eyes are obscured by noise—the brain’s prior expectation of direct gaze exerts a stronger influence on perception. 
In their experiments, participants viewed synthetic faces with varied gaze deviations under conditions of both low and high uncertainty. By adding fractal noise selectively to the eye region, the researchers manipulated the reliability of the sensory signal. The responses, measured as the proportion of “direct” versus “averted” gaze judgments, were then fitted with a logistic function to estimate discrimination thresholds and biases. 
The data showed that increased uncertainty resulted in a systematic shift: ambiguous stimuli were more likely to be perceived as looking directly at the observer. Moreover, the Bayesian model, incorporating a Gaussian prior, accounted for a large proportion of the variance in the observed judgments. 
The study concludes that the adult visual system not only processes sensory gaze information but also relies on prior expectations, a mechanism that may have important implications for social communication and understanding atypical gaze processing in clinical populations![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46c78037-6541-442e-a45a-578b9c07d71d)
